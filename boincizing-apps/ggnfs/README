x64 ggnfs can be a bit tricky to build - it's not an automagic process.

Obviously, apply the patches first.


If you need to switch to gcc44:
 - /trunk/Makefile
 - /trunk/src/experimental/lasieve4_64/x64/Makefile
 - /trunk/src/experimental/lasieve4_64/athlon64/Makefile
 - and potentially a couple others if you're on a mips or itanium arch
   but if you are, it may not build easily anyway....
 

Build.
From:  /trunk/src/experimental/lasieve4_64/INSTALL
============================================================================ 
follow these steps to build the binaries on a 64-bit machine.
These should build and run on Athlon64, or Core2 cpus.

******************************
NOTE for Phenom/K8 users: replace in athlon64/ls-defs.asm
 define(l1_bits,15)dnl
=>
 define(l1_bits,16)dnl

and in athlon64/siever-config.h
#define L1_BITS 15
=>
#define L1_BITS 16

This may add 5-10% speed to your sieving speed.
But try it both ways and decide for yourself. Caveat emptor!
******************************

Prerequisites: gmp.h libgmp

cd athlon64
make liblasieve.a
make liblasieveI11.a
make liblasieveI12.a
make liblasieveI13.a
make liblasieveI14.a
make liblasieveI15.a
make liblasieveI16.a
cp *.a ..
cd ..
ln -s athlon64 asm
make
============================================================================
 
Then you'll have the boinc and non-boinc static apps.

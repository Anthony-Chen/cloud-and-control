boinc-client-autostart
	I had issues with the supplied boinc-client init script.  This is my 
	slightly edited version, as well as the one I used to autostart and 
	autoattach for automating EC2 instances.  (Best compared in a diff tool.)
	
	You will need to edit the autostart file. Look for YOURBOINCURL & 
	YOURACCOUNTSECRET

	
client-curl-fix.patch
	BOINC was erroring when downloading files with special characters.
	This patch fixes it ONLY for spaces.
	See http://lists.ssl.berkeley.edu/pipermail/boinc_dev/2011-September/018007.html
client-debugging-info.patch
	Adds some debugging information to the logfile that had to do with resource 
	estimation.
client-app-running.patch
	1) Edits the wrapper app to NOT append command line arguments when it is 
	   running a task that begins with "7z".  Was causing 'command not 
	   recognized' with 7z
	2) Does not append GPU specific command line arguments when running GPU apps
	   Again, causing 'command not recognized' errors, this time with 
	   cudahashcat+
client-platform-tomfoolery.patch
	See TODO
	
	
server-moreapps.patch
	I ran into a limit with BOINC where I added more apps and verions than it 
	had a limit for.  I upped it.  It's annoying to do this midway through,
	I suggest you up it in the beginning.
server-multithreaded.patch
	A patch to change a command line argument from --nthreads to --threads
	to work with hashcat.
	Also some more verbose diagnostic info.

	
server-builddirs.patch	
client-builddirs.patch
	TODO

These scripts and queries are for getting statistics out of large runs.

YOU WILL NEED TO EDIT THEM BEFORE RUNNING.

 - I limit on the id of the apps for each script.  It looks like:
		a.id IN (15, 17) 
   You will need to change those hardcoded id's to be the ids in your app table
   for the specific app of the script.

   
msieve-parse.txt
   Parses out data for the polynomial selection runs.  A single SQL Query
   
john-parse.php
   A PHP script that must be run prior to the sql query.  It needs to know
   the location of the wordlist files, and will make a db table that contains
   the number of words in each file.
john-parse.txt
   The SQL query that will give you a bunch of information like number of 
   cracks, estimation of floating point operations/word and stuff like that.
   For non-trivial hash types/longer wordlists, it will show you how close the 
   estimate came to actual execution.  (Unix MD5, and such).

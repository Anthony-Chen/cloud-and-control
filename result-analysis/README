These are big tables of data from a few factoring runs and the korelogic 2010
cracking data.

Cracking Analysis
================================================================================

korelogic-trial-run-all-results.xlsx
	Here's the motherload of cracking results data.  How well I estimated,
	what wordlists crackes the most passwords (this is a little skewed, cause I
	would try and remove cracked passwords from later processing), floating 
	point operations per worldist word, for all the hash types.
	
korelogic-trial-run-hashtypes.gnumeric
	The graphs from "Failure by Hash Type".
	This shows how many I cracked, I didn't crack, and No one cracked, from the 
	2010 contest.

Factoring	
================================================================================

Factoring Graphs.gnumeric
	This contains a lot of raw data, and some preliminary goal-seek data for
	different sievers and polynomials. The other files are more specific.

fpops per q comparison.gnumeric
	This is the data and graphs relating to floating point operations spent for
	a given Q range for different sievers and polynomials .
	
relations per q comparison.gnumeric
	This is the data and graphs to get the curves for relations obtained for 
	different sievers and polynomials as a function of the Q range.

sec per rel comparison.gnumeric
	This graph wasn't used, but it's the data and graph for seconds spent to 
	obtain a relation for different sievers and polynomials.
	
relations under the curve.gnumeric
	This is the data and graphs to get a dollar figure for each of the different
	sievers/polynomials.

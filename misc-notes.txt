The Amazon AMIs often have some old version of gcc, and you need to emerge/apt-get/yum install/whatever gcc44 and edit the makefile to use that.

I was working off BOINC 6.11.1
	svn co http://boinc.berkeley.edu/svn/branches/server_stable
	http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/SourceCode

==============================

You'll see I use xz compression in places.  7z doesn't allow streaming 
compression.  You can't decompress from stdin, you need to give an actual 
filename.  (So you couldn't 7zcat or 7zless like you can zcat, zless, xzcat, 
and xzless.)  I decompress in the job.xml files by wiring up stdin and stdout, 
so I needed a compression function that could do so. xz gives great compression
and the feature I needed.

==============================

I did some horrible shenanigans with my BOINC server, for reasons not terribly
interesting to this presentation, where instead of having a platform like 
'linux' I made custom platforms for each individual CPU architecture.

You don't have to do this.  You should be aware of it though, so everywhere you 
see a bunch of directories 'barcelona', 'nocona', you can just replace them in
your mind with 'linux'.

If you want to do this anyway:
1) define your platforms in project.xml
2) Instead of _linux as a platform, put your custom one.
3) When you comile the boinc client, after you ./configure but before you make
   edit config.h and set HOSTTYPE.
   #define HOSTTYPE "x32-nocona"

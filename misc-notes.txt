The Amazon AMIs often have some old version of gcc, and you need to emerge/apt-get/yum install/whatever gcc44 and edit the makefile to use that.

I was working off BOINC 6.11.1

You'll see I use xz compression in places.  7z doesn't allow streaming 
compression.  You can't decompress from stdin, you need to give an actual 
filename.  (So you couldn't 7zcat or 7zless like you can zcat, zless, xzcat, 
and xzless.)  I decompress in the job.xml files by wiring up stdin and stdout, 
so I needed a compression function that could do so. xz gives great compression
and the feature I needed.
